Hello world!

I am Matt Brody and thank you for taking the time to visit my website.

Currently, I am a Technology Assistant for Dallas School District 2 in Dallas, Oregon. I help repair and maintain the districtâ€™s computers, networks, and provide a point of contact for the teaching/administration staff.

This website will serve as my professional landing page with links to my github account and resume. It will also serve as my personal blog, where I will discuss a variety of topics including technology, my own professional development, cycling, politics, and whatever else occupies my mind on a given day.

Feel free to read, share, and leave a comment if you find my content enjoyable.

Thank you again and take care!

Matt Brody
